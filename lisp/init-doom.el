PACKAGE is a symbol or list of them. These are package names, not modes,
functions or variables. It can be:

- An unquoted package symbol (the name of a package)

- An unquoted list of package symbols (i.e. BODY is evaluated once both magit
  and git-gutter have loaded)

- An unquoted, nested list of compound package lists, using any combination of

  Without :or/:any/:and/:all, :and/:all are implied.

1. Suppresses warnings for disabled packages at compile-time
